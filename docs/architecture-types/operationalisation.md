# Operationalisation — pure-data helpers and soundness pins

The Architectural Type System for Verum (ATS-V) lives at two
levels: the **declarative surface** that cogs use to annotate
themselves (`@arch_module(...)`, `Capability`, `Lifecycle`, …),
and the **kernel-discharge layer** that enforces invariants the
declarative surface cannot decide locally.

Between them sits a third layer: **operationalisation**.  Every
methodological concept that is pure data — that can be computed
deterministically from the surface types alone — is exposed as a
`public fn` on the Verum side, not just an axiom.  Verum cogs
can compute lifecycle ranks, stratum admissibility, foundation
subsumption, modal classifications, observer rosters, and so on
without crossing the FFI boundary into the kernel.

This page enumerates the operationalised surface, explains *why*
each helper is decidable on pure data, and documents the
**soundness pins** — invariants that catch silent drift between
the Verum side and the kernel side.

## 1. Why a third layer

Pure declarations leak responsibility to the kernel.  Every check
becomes an axiom that says "trust me, the Rust side computes this
correctly."  That is appropriate when the check genuinely needs
information the AST cannot see (capability-flow inference from a
function body, type-system unification, SMT-discharged
refinements).  It is *inappropriate* for the many concepts that
are simple folds over the surface types — `lifecycle_rank` is a
match expression with nine arms, nothing more.

When such concepts hide behind axioms, three things rot:

1. **Discoverability.** LSP completion has nothing to show.  An
   author writing `@arch_module(lifecycle = ...)` cannot ask the
   editor "what rank does this resolve to?"
2. **Verum-side proofs.** Theorems about lifecycle ordering,
   foundation subsumption, etc. cannot be expressed in Verum at
   all if the relevant predicates exist only as Rust functions.
3. **Cross-side drift.** When the Verum side has no operational
   counterpart, drift between the Rust and the Verum surface goes
   undetected until a real cog miscompiles.

The third layer closes all three: helpers live in `.vr` files
next to the types they operate on; cogs can prove properties about
them; the cross-side pin test compares both sides.

## 3. Soundness pins

A **soundness pin** is a Verum-side function that asserts a
non-trivial property of the helpers, derivable from the helpers
alone.  Pins serve as executable specification — they fail loudly
if the helper implementations drift from their contract, and they
form the natural foundation for stronger Verum-level proofs.

### 3.1 Pins in `core.architecture.types`

```verum
public fn lifecycle_rank_strict_order_holds() -> Bool
public fn stratum_l_abs_unique_inadmissible() -> Bool
public fn foundation_canonical_inclusions_hold() -> Bool
public fn tier_check_runs_nothing() -> Bool
```

Each evaluates to `true` on a correct implementation; the
cross-side pin test exercises them.

### 3.2 Pins in `core.architecture.mtac`

```verum
public fn observer_roster_size_invariant() -> Bool
public fn modal_temporal_disjoint() -> Bool
public fn time_counterfactual_branches_isolated() -> Bool
public fn adjunction_mirror_symmetry() -> Bool
```

### 3.3 Pins in `core.architecture.anti_patterns` / `corpus` / `parse`

```verum
public fn anti_pattern_roster_size_invariant() -> Bool   // 32
public fn corpus_invariant_roster_size_invariant() -> Bool  // 4
public fn arch_module_field_count_invariant() -> Bool    // 13
```

## 4. Cross-side alignment guarantee

The Verum-side helpers are not the source of truth — the kernel
is.  The Rust-side `verum_kernel::arch::*` modules contain
identical computations for every helper above (e.g.
`Lifecycle::rank`, `Foundation::directly_subsumed_by`,
`Tier::compatible_with`).  Any drift between the two sides
breaks the architectural type checker.

To prevent silent drift, the cross-side pin test in
`crates/verum_kernel/tests/k_arch_v_alignment.rs` enumerates the
canonical roster — variant counts, variant tag strings, helper
function presence by name — and asserts both sides agree.  The
test:

1. Reads `core/architecture/*.vr` as text and extracts the
   declared variants and helper signatures.
2. Compares against a hard-coded canonical roster maintained in
   the test file itself.
3. Asserts the kernel side has the same shape via the Rust enum
   reflection (`tag()`, `code()`, `full_canonical_roster()`).

When a contributor adds a variant on either side without updating
the other, CI fails with a concrete message naming the missing
counterpart.

## 5. Why the helpers are pure data

A property is *decidable on pure data* if its evaluation requires
only the values of the input — no kernel state, no FFI, no SMT
solver, no AST traversal beyond the input itself.  The helpers
above all satisfy this:

- `lifecycle_rank` matches on the variant — 9 arms, constant time.
- `stratum_is_admissible` matches on the variant — 4 arms.
- `foundation_directly_subsumed_by` matches on the pair —
  finite case analysis.
- `tier_compatible_with` is essentially the same shape with a
  bounded inner `tier_list_contains` walk.
- `cve_closure_degree` counts `Some` discriminants on a
  three-field record.
- `time_point_precedes` matches on the pair — branching futures
  are explicitly incomparable.

What is *not* pure data:

- **Capability-flow inference.** Determining the capability set
  a function body actually exercises requires walking the typed
  AST.  This stays in the kernel (AP-001 CapabilityEscalation).
- **Boundary invariant verification.** Whether the cog's actual
  message-passing code preserves the declared invariants is a
  body-level property, not a Shape-level one.
- **Composition graph cycle detection.** Requires the full
  module-graph view, not a single Shape.

These remain `@kernel_discharge(...)` axioms.  The discipline:
*if* a property is decidable from the surface types alone, it
becomes a `public fn`; otherwise, it stays a kernel-discharge
axiom.

## 6. Auxiliary typed attributes

Beyond `@arch_module(...)`, the ATS-V surface ships four auxiliary
typed attributes that complement the main carrier with focused,
orthogonal annotations.  All four use the same generic
`attribute_args = named_arg_list` grammar form — no new grammar
production was introduced.  The kernel parser dispatches on
attribute name through dedicated functions in `arch_parse.rs`.

### 6.1 `@bridge_tier(from: Tier.X, to: Tier.Y)`

Lifts the AP-004 TierMixing ban for the annotated function.  A
bridge does not eliminate the cost of the cross-tier transition;
it merely declares it intentional.  The runtime inserts the
appropriate transition (Interp call from Aot, GPU launch from Aot,
etc.) at the call site, and the audit chronicle records every
bridge for review.

```verum
@bridge_tier(from: Tier.Aot, to: Tier.Interp)
public fn dump_for_debug(tx: Tx) -> ()
```

The kernel-side type is `verum_kernel::arch::BridgeTier`; the
parser is `verum_kernel::arch_parse::parse_bridge_tier`.  A
no-op bridge (`from == to`) is parseable but flagged by the
architectural type-checker.

### 6.2 `@deterministic`

A marker attribute (no args) declaring that a function must
produce identical output on identical inputs across runs / hosts /
clock domains.  Consumed by AP-015 DeterministicViolation:
invocations of non-deterministic primitives (Random, SystemTime,
FilesystemMtime, network) within the marked function raise the
violation.

```verum
@deterministic
public fn hash_block(block: &Block) -> Bytes32
```

Determinism is the foundation of replay verification and DST
testing.

### 6.3 `@mtac_decision { point, by_observer, proposition, modality }`

Attaches a typed Modal-Temporal Architectural Calculus claim to a
function or cog.  Each MtacDecision is a dated, observer-witnessed,
modally-typed architectural commitment — the unit of historical
record in the MTAC corpus.

```verum
@mtac_decision {
    point: TimePoint.Now,
    by_observer: Observer.Auditor,
    proposition: ArchProposition.FoundationStable,
    modality: ModalAssertion.Necessity,
}
public fn checkout_payment(amount: Money) -> Result<...>
```

The four fields are required; missing any raises
`ArchParseError::MissingRequired`.  The ATS-V phase records the
claim for the MTAC anti-pattern checks (AP-027 TemporalInconsistency,
AP-028 CounterfactualBrittleness, AP-031 PhantomEvolution).

### 6.4 `@arch_corpus(invariants, foundation_bridges)`

Scope attribute for cross-cog invariants.  Where `@arch_module(...)`
describes a single cog's Shape, `@arch_corpus(...)` describes
properties holding over the entire corpus.

```verum
@arch_corpus(
    invariants: [
        CorpusInvariant.NoCircularDependencies,
        CorpusInvariant.FoundationConsistency,
        CorpusInvariant.NoLAbsClaim,
        CorpusInvariant.CapabilityClosure,
    ],
    foundation_bridges: [
        ("legacy.zfc_module", "zfc_to_hott_bridge_corpus"),
    ],
)
module my_app.corpus_root;
```

Both fields are optional; missing fields default to "use the
canonical 4-roster" / "no bridges declared".  The
`foundation_bridges` declarations suppress AP-005 FoundationDrift
for the named pairs.

## 7. Migration note — `Tier::TierCheck` → `Tier::Check`

Earlier drafts of `core.architecture.types.Tier` exposed a
variant named `TierCheck`.  The kernel-side parser in
`verum_kernel::arch_parse` accepts only the bare name `Check`
(matching the Rust enum's `Tier::Check` variant).  Code written
as `@arch_module(at_tier = Tier.TierCheck)` therefore never
compiled — the parser raised `UnknownVariant{kind: "Tier", value:
"TierCheck"}`.

The variant has been renamed to `Tier.Check` to match the parser.
The cross-side pin test now asserts both sides use the same
identifier.  If you have existing code referencing `Tier.TierCheck`,
rename it to `Tier.Check`.
