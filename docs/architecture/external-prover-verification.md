## 1. Why this gate exists

Verum's kernel-soundness pipeline ([`verum audit --kernel-soundness`](../verification/cli-workflow.md))
historically did three things:

1. Drift-checked the Rust-side rule list against the `.vr` corpus.
2. Enumerated per-rule status (`Proved` / `Admitted` / `DischargedByFramework`).
3. **Emitted** parallel Lean 4 + Coq theory files into
   `target/audit-reports/kernel-soundness/` for "independent re-checking".

Step 3 was load-bearing **on paper** but never invoked in CI. A
foreign auditor was supposed to run `lake build` / `coqc`
themselves. This is exactly the kind of trust-trap the pipeline was
meant to *prevent*: the output existed, it looked plausible, and
nothing mechanical confirmed Lean / Coq would actually accept it.

When this gate first ran it caught **four type errors** in the
supposedly-proved lemmas — broken proof tactics that had been in
the emitter for the entire history of the corpus:

| Rule | Error | Root cause |
|------|-------|------------|
| `K_Var_sound`   | `ctx_lookup_sound Hrule Hwf` applied a Prop where a `CoreTerm` was expected | proof emitter used the wrong names from `intros` |
| `K_Univ_sound`  | `exact universe_form_sound` left ∀-residue | `intros d Hrule` consumed only 2 binders, leaving `t T : CoreTerm` |
| `K_FwAx_sound`  | `axiom_body_typed_in_prop body_prop` — `body_prop` undefined | the emitter `rcases`'d a Prop as a tuple |
| `K_Pos_sound`   | `strict_positivity_sound strict_pos` — `strict_pos` was a `ByteArray` | same `rcases` mistake |

`verum audit --kernel-soundness` had reported the gate green for
all four because it never asked Lean. `verum audit --external-prover-replay`
fails immediately on this kind of regression.

## 2. What gets verified

### 2.1 Verum-side source of truth

- `core/verify/kernel_soundness/` — the corpus (rule list, lemma
  names, admit reasons, framework citations).
- `crates/verum_kernel/src/proof_tree.rs::KernelRule` — the
  Rust-side enum mirror (38 rules).
- `crates/verum_kernel/src/soundness/` — the cross-export pipeline
  (`SoundnessExporter`, `LeanBackend`, `CoqBackend`).

The audit gate `--kernel-soundness` drift-checks all three.

### 2.2 Foreign-tool re-check

`verum audit --external-prover-replay` extends the gate with a real
shell-out:

| Backend | Tool | Project | Invocation |
|---------|------|---------|------------|
| Lean 4 (4.29.1+) | `lake build` | `verification/external/lean/` | builds `VerumExternalReplay/KernelSoundness.lean` |
| Coq / Rocq (9.0+) | `coqc -Q . VerumExternalReplay kernel_soundness.v` | `verification/external/coq/` | type-checks the export |

Each backend reports one of four verdicts:

- **`clean`** — backend exited 0 with no diagnostics. The
  kernel-soundness theorem typechecks unconditionally.
- **`iou-only`** — backend exited 0; the only diagnostics are
  honest IOUs (`sorry` warnings in Lean, `Admitted.` lines in Coq)
  whose count matches the corpus's declared admit list. *This is
  the default green state* — the corpus has 27 outstanding admits +
  7 framework-discharged + 4 placeholder-proved.
- **`hard-error`** — backend rejected the export with a real
  type / parse / scoping error. Load-bearing regression. Exits
  non-zero.
- **`not-available`** — backend binary missing. Advisory unless
  `--strict`; CI uses `--strict`.

## 3. What's NOT verified (honest IOUs)

The four "Proved" lemmas (`K_Var`, `K_Univ`, `K_FwAx`, `K_Pos`)
are discharged via **placeholder axioms** in the emitted file:

```lean
axiom ctx_lookup_sound : ∀ t T, well_typed t T
axiom universe_form_sound : ∀ t T, well_typed t T
axiom axiom_body_typed_in_prop : ∀ t T, well_typed t T
axiom strict_positivity_sound : ∀ t T, well_typed t T
```

These axioms are **vacuously true** — `well_typed` is itself an
opaque axiom. Their job is to discharge the soundness statements
*at the level of theorem statement well-formedness*, not at the
level of meta-theoretic content.

So `external-prover-replay` verifies:

- ✅ Every emitted theorem statement parses and type-checks in
  the foreign tool.
- ✅ Every `Admitted` / `sorry` carries the same admit reason as
  the Verum corpus (drift-detected).
- ✅ The shape of `CoreTerm`, `CoreType`, `KernelRule` mirrors the
  Rust enums exactly (encoder bug surface).
- ❌ It does **not** verify that the kernel rules are actually
  sound with respect to a denotational model. That's a separate,
  deeper effort tracked under "Kernel meta-theory in Mathlib" in
  the verification roadmap.

## 4. The 27 outstanding IOUs

Each admitted lemma names exactly the meta-theory it depends on.
The audit's plain output enumerates every reason verbatim; here
they group by category:

### Cubical (6) — CCHM / HoTT mechanisation

`K_Path_Ty_Form`, `K_Path_Over_Form`, `K_Refl_Intro`, `K_HComp`,
`K_Transp`, `K_Glue`

Discharge plan: port the cubical-type-theory chapter of
[`agda/cubical`](https://github.com/agda/cubical) to a Lean 4
fragment; or wait for `mathlib4`'s nascent CCHM port.

### Refinement (4) — Definition 136.D1 + Lemma 136.L0

`K_Refine`, `K_Refine_Omega`, `K_Refine_Intro`, `K_Refine_Erase`

Discharge plan: formalise the refinement-typing hierarchy +
ordinal modal-depth bound. Both are stated in
`crates/verum_kernel/src/eps_mu.rs` but the Lean-side proofs are
admitted.

### Quotient (3) — equivalence-relation properties

`K_Quot_Form`, `K_Quot_Intro`, `K_Quot_Elim`

Discharge plan: lift `Mathlib.Logic.Equiv` + `Quotient.mk` /
`Quotient.lift` mathlib lemmas through the export.

### Inductive (2) — positivity decision procedure

`K_Inductive`, `K_Elim`

Discharge plan: port Verum's strict-positivity checker into a
Lean `Decidable` instance.

### SMT/Axiom (1) — replay correctness

`K_Smt`

Discharge plan: state "every cert that
`verum_kernel::replay_smt_cert` accepts denotes a well-typed
CoreTerm derivation" as a Lean predicate over a model of SMT
certificates.

### Diakrisis (11) — universe ascent, cohesive modalities, Eps/Mu

`K_Eps_Mu`, `K_Universe_Ascent`, `K_Round_Trip`, `K_Epsilon_Of`,
`K_Alpha_Of`, `K_Modal_Box`, `K_Modal_Diamond`, `K_Modal_Big_And`,
`K_Shape`, `K_Flat`, `K_Sharp`

Discharge plan: these depend on Schreiber DCCT (`schreiber_dcct`
framework, 5 axioms in `core/math/frameworks/`), Shulman 2018 §3,
and Lurie HTT — none has a mature mathlib port today. Tracked
separately under the Diakrisis bridge-roster.

## 5. Running locally

```bash
# Prerequisites:
#   • Lean 4 via elan: https://leanprover.github.io/get_started/
#   • Rocq / Coq 9.x: brew install rocq  (macOS)
#                     apt install coq    (Debian/Ubuntu, pre-Rocq)

# Default — runs both backends, soft-fails on missing tools.
verum audit --external-prover-replay

# Lean only (faster on a fresh machine — Lake bootstraps quickly).
verum audit --external-prover-replay --backend lean

# CI-grade strict mode.  Fails the gate if any backend isn't
# installed; required reading for `--strict` is "if you can't
# install it, you can't claim it works".
verum audit --external-prover-replay --strict

# JSON for machine consumption.  Output written to
# target/audit-reports/external-prover-replay.json + stdout.
verum audit --external-prover-replay --format json
```

## 6. Wiring in CI

The gate is part of `verum audit --bundle` (the umbrella audit).
Add to the GitHub Actions matrix:

```yaml
- name: External-prover replay (Lean + Coq)
  run: |
    # elan + lake
    curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh \
      | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain leanprover/lean4:v4.29.1
    source $HOME/.elan/env
    # rocq via apt or brew, depending on runner OS
    sudo apt-get install -y coq
    # the gate
    verum audit --external-prover-replay --strict
```

## 7. Maintenance

When **adding** a kernel rule:

1. Append to `KernelRule` enum in `crates/verum_kernel/src/proof_tree.rs`.
2. Append a `RuleSpec` to `canonical_rules()` in
   `crates/verum_kernel/src/soundness/mod.rs` with status set to
   `admitted("<concrete IOU citing meta-theory dependency>")`.
3. Mirror in `core/verify/kernel_soundness/theorems.vr` (drift gate).
4. Run `verum audit --external-prover-replay`. The gate must stay
   green: `iou-only` is fine, `hard-error` means the Lean / Coq
   emission is broken — fix the emitter before merging.

When **promoting** an admit to a real proof:

1. Replace `admitted(...)` with `proved(coq_tactics, lean_tactics)`.
2. Provide a concrete tactic chain that closes the goal against
   the placeholder axioms (or — better — a real proof that doesn't
   rely on them).
3. Rerun the gate. The IOU count decreases; CI doesn't care about
   the absolute number, only about hard-errors.
